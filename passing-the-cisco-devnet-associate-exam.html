<p>Passing the <strong>Cisco Certified DevNet Associate</strong> exam (DevAsc) was a major milestone on my journey into network automation and programmability. I want to share my study process in hopes it can help others approaching this certification.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<hr>
<h2>üß† My Study Approach: Structured Learning with Iterative Quizzing</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Starting with CBT Nuggets</strong></h3>
<p>I began by diving into the <strong>CBT Nuggets course</strong> titled <em>Cisco DevNet Associate (200-901 DEVASC)</em>. This course was comprehensive and provided a solid foundation on the key concepts of network automation and programmability. It covered topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco platforms (e.g., Intersight, DNA Center, Meraki, NSO)</li>
<li>Automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Netmiko, Python)</li>
<li>APIs (REST, SOAP, AXL, CTI in CUCM)</li>
<li>Authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth, Bearer)</li>
<li>Network protocols (SNMP, MDT)</li>
<li>CI/CD practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</li>
<li>Unit testing and more</li>
</ul>
<p>This course gave me a good theoretical foundation, but I knew I needed to test my knowledge more rigorously.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Taking the Kaplan Practice Test</strong></h3>
<p>Next, I took a <strong>practice test</strong> provided by <strong>Kaplan</strong>, which was included as part of the CBT Nuggets course. This gave me a solid gauge of where I stood in terms of readiness. The only downside was that it created a quiz based on a question bank of only 200 questions, which I quickly went through. However, I was able to pinpoint the areas where I needed further improvement. This step was crucial in tailoring the next phase of my study plan.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Using ChatGPT for Targeted Learning and Quizzes</strong></h3>
<p>Once I identified the areas I struggled with, I turned to <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for deeper explanations and to create <strong>custom quizzes</strong>. ChatGPT helped me dig deeper into topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>API request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
<li>JSON, YAML, YANG, and NETCONF</li>
<li>Ansible vs. Python scripting</li>
<li>SD-WAN and Meraki comparisons</li>
<li>Authentication methods (OAuth vs. Basic Auth)</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT quizzes were incredibly helpful as they allowed me to test my understanding of specific concepts. Initially, I started with standard multiple-choice questions but quickly wanted a more challenging approach. Instead of simply receiving a question with answer choices, I asked ChatGPT to provide the question alone. I would then explain my reasoning and how I arrived at my answer. ChatGPT would confirm whether my response was correct and offer additional context to help solidify my understanding.</p>
<p>If I got a question wrong, I would take the time to pause the quizzing and do a quick <strong>deep dive</strong> on that specific topic to reinforce my understanding. This process of revisiting areas where I was weak allowed me to improve steadily and get comfortable with even the trickier concepts.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Expanding to a General Overview with ChatGPT Quizzes</strong></h3>
<p>After successfully improving in the targeted areas, I broadened my review with more <strong>general DevNet exam questions</strong>. ChatGPT provided quizzes that spanned the entire exam, covering topics from APIs to CI/CD, and everything in between. The quizzes helped me solidify my knowledge and ensure I was prepared for any part of the exam.</p>
<hr>
<h2>üîÅ Learning by Iteration</h2>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me was the power of <strong>active learning</strong>. Rather than just reading through material, I actively engaged by taking quizzes, working through problems, and using ChatGPT to clarify difficult concepts. By iterating on what I had learned, I gained a much stronger grasp of the material.</p>
<hr>
<h2>üìò Exam Tips</h2>
<p>Here are some of the key things I recommend you focus on when studying for the DevNet Associate exam:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cisco platforms</strong>: Be able to compare and contrast them (e.g., when to use NSO vs. Meraki).</li>
<li><strong>HTTP methods</strong>: Know the difference between <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and where they fit in REST APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Data formats</strong>: Understand the ins and outs of <strong>JSON</strong>, <strong>YAML</strong>, <strong>YANG</strong>, and <strong>NETCONF</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>: Be familiar with concepts around <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> and <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong>: Understand how <strong>Git</strong> works and its role in collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication mechanisms</strong>: Differentiate between <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> and <strong>Basic Auth</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Unit testing</strong>: Know when to use <strong>unit testing</strong> frameworks like <code>unittest</code> and how they fit into the DevNet workflow.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>üìã My Exam Experience</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of taking exams in a <strong>testing center</strong> instead of at home. This helps me focus and ensures I‚Äôm in the right mindset as well as removing any potential distractions and worries that I have my work area all set up. Since I started taking exams in testing centers (knock on wood), I haven‚Äôt failed any of the exams I‚Äôve taken there.</p>
<p>When I first sat down for the exam, I‚Äôll admit, I was nervous. However, once I got into the groove of answering the questions, those nerves started to fade away. The ChatGPT quizzes were incredibly helpful, and there were at least two questions that were directly related to my learning there. Otherwise, there was never a point where I felt completely thrown off. All of the questions were in line with the practice quizzes I had taken, and I felt prepared for what came my way.</p>
<p>Of course, there were a few questions where I didn‚Äôt know the exact answer or wasn‚Äôt sure about the reasoning behind the options, but what would a quiz be without a few challenges?</p>
<hr>
<h2>üí¨ Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Passing the DevNet Associate exam wasn‚Äôt just about memorizing concepts; it was about actively engaging with the material, testing my knowledge, and iterating until I was confident. By combining the <strong>CBT Nuggets course</strong>, <strong>Kaplan practice tests</strong>, and <strong>ChatGPT quizzes</strong>, I was able to build a strong foundation and thoroughly prepare for the exam.</p>
