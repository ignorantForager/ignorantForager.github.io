Title: About

I’m **Cadence James**, a Network Engineer and automation enthusiast with a passion for scripting and streamlining network operations. I specialize in **PowerShell** and am expanding my skills with **Python** and **Ansible**. 

When I’m not working with enterprise networks, I enjoy experimenting in my **homelab**, testing new technologies, and learning more about automation and infrastructure. I also love engaging with the tech community and sharing knowledge.
