<h2>Background</h2>
<p>About a year and a half ago, I was asked to find a way to extract metrics from Cisco Unified Call Manager (CUCM) to support our Service Desk team. They needed basic insights:
- How many calls were made to the service desk
- Who answered the calls
- How many calls went to voicemail</p>
<p>Over time, additional requests came in, such as tracking evening-hour calls to determine if extra support was needed.</p>
<h2>Initial Challenges</h2>
<p>After some research, I found that CUCM didnâ€™t provide an easy way to access this information through its â€¦</p>

<p>Understanding the quantity and distribution of 100GB QSFP transceivers in your data center can be essential for optimizing network performance. But how can you efficiently gather this information across multiple devices? Let me share with you a straightforward method Iâ€™ve developed using PowerShell, which you can adapt to suit your environment.</p>
<p>Firstly, I typically start by SSHâ€™ing into my devices to manually gather information. This initial exploration helps me identify patterns that can be automated later. One command Iâ€™ve found to be particularly useful is <code>show interface transceiver</code>, which lists â€¦</p>
