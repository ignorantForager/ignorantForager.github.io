<p>It started with an exciting vision: to build a true "endgame" home server. The goal was to consolidate my sprawling setup into a single, powerful All-in-One server. I already had the chassis, a 45Drives HL15, and the storageâ€”fifteen 20TB Seagate drives ready to go. Now, I just needed to pick the brains of the operation.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, I landed on what felt like a killer combo for a TrueNAS SCALE build.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago, I was asked to find a way to extract metrics from Cisco Unified Call Manager (CUCM) to support our Service Desk team. They needed basic insights:
- How many calls were made to the service desk
- Who answered the calls
- How many calls went to voicemail</p>
<p>Over time, additional requests came in, such as tracking evening-hour calls to determine if extra support was needed.</p>

<p>Managing disk space efficiently is crucial for maintaining a stable Plex Media Server, especially when running it as a Docker container on an Ubuntu Live Server VM. Recently, I encountered a critical issue where Plex failed to start and transcode media due to insufficient disk space. Additionally, system updates were blocked due to a full root partition. This post details the root cause analysis, troubleshooting steps, and resolution strategies, including mounting a secondary drive for Plex storage. By following these steps, you can prevent similar issues and optimize your Plex serverâ€™s performance.</p>

Let me share with you a straightforward method Iâ€™ve developed using PowerShell, which you can adapt to suit your environment.</p>
<p>Firstly, I typically start by SSHâ€™ing into my devices to manually gather information. This initial exploration helps me identify patterns that can be automated later. One command Iâ€™ve found to be particularly useful is <code>show interface transceiver</code>, which lists â€¦</p>
